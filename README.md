# 📊 Data Analytics Project: [Customer Behavior Analyze]

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis workflow designed to extract actionable insights from a raw dataset. The process encompasses data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation, and reporting. The goal is to demonstrate a complete, end-to-end analytical skillset relevant to a data analyst role.

## Dataset
*   **Source:** [Customer_Shopping_Behvaior.csv]
*   **Description:** The dataset contains [3900] records of [Customer Shopping Behvaior].
*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   `orderID`: Unique identifier for each order.
    *   `product`: Name of the product purchased.
    *   `Subscription_status`: Number of units sold.
    *   `price`: Unit price of the product.
    *   `orderDate`: Date of the transaction.
    *   `customerID`: Unique identifier for the customer.
    

## Tools & Technologies
| **Data Analysis & Cleaning**: Python (Pandas)
| **Database Management**: MySQL
| **Data Visualization**: Power BI 
| **Reporting & Presentation**: Microsoft PowerPoint, Gamma App |

## Project Steps
The analysis was conducted in a structured, multi-stage process:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Inspection:**
    *   The dataset was loaded into a Python Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas library.
    *   Initial checks were performed to understand the data structure, data types, and identify immediate issues like missing values or duplicates.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand distributions and relationships between variables.

3.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    *   Handled missing values through imputation or removal.
    *   Corrected inconsistent data formats (e.g., dates, categories).
    *   Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant data points to ensure data quality for analysis.

4.  **SQL Analysis (MySQL):**
    *   The cleaned dataset was exported and imported into a MySQL database.
    *   Wrote and executed complex SQL queries to answer key business questions, such as:
        *   "What are the top 10 best-selling products?"
        *   "What is the monthly sales trend?"

5.  **Dashboard & Visualization (Power BI):**
    *   Connected Power BI directly to the MySQL database for a dynamic data connection.
    *   Built an interactive dashboard with key metrics (KPIs), charts, and filters to allow for drill-down analysis.
    *   The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of business performance.

6.  **Reporting & Presentation:**
    *   A summary report was created, detailing the methodology, key findings, and recommendations.
    *   A concise and visually appealing presentation was built using **Gamma** to effectively communicate the insights to a non-technical audience.

## Power BI Dashboard
The interactive dashboard provides a high-level overview of the key metrics.

**Key Features:**
*   **Total Sales, Quantity, and Unique Customers** as KPIs.
*   **Sales Trend** over time (Monthly/Quarterly).
*   **Top Products** by sales volume.
*   **Sales by Country** on a map or bar chart.
*   Interactive filters for Date Range, Country, and Product.
